#Instructions:
#    Problem 1: 
#        Description 
#            Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000), find the year with the most number of people alive.
#        Code 
#            Solve using a language of your choice and dataset of your own creation.
#        Submission 
#            Please upload your code, dataset, and example of the programâ€™s output to Bit Bucket or Github. Please include any graphs or charts created by your program.

# Note this was my first time using Ruby, so it may not conform to Ruby coding norms
